    APP-NAME field of the Syslog message as defined in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6.2.5">RFC 5424 - The syslog Protocol</a>.

    <blockquote cite="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5424#section-6.2.5">
        The APP-NAME field SHOULD identify the device or application that
        originated the message.  It is a string without further semantics.
        It is intended for filtering messages on a relay or collector.<br/>
        <br/>
        The NILVALUE MAY be used when the syslog application has no idea of
        its APP-NAME or cannot provide that information.  It may be that a
        device is unable to provide that information either because of a
        local policy decision, or because the information is not available,
        or not applicable, on the device.<br/>
        <br/>
        This field MAY be operator-assigned.<br/>
